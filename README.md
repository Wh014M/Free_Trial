# Free Trial
A Simple android application (and platform-agnostic REST-API) that enables you to offer a free trial to your app users.

# How it Works
1. When user installs the application, on first launch, the application will start tracking usage limit.
2. The user will be updated with the remaining days left of the trial period of the application
3. When trial is about to end, user will be given a warning to upgrade so they can continue using the application
4. When the free trial period is due, In-App Purchase will be presented to the user for upgrade in order to continue using the application
5. If user refuses to upgrade, app exits.

# FEATURE AND DESIGN PATTERN
1. MVVM
2. Android-X

# TODO:
1. Logic for In-App Purchase
2. Logic to check if purchase/upgrade has been made else exit the app if not made

this project was done at my spare time, when i am less busy, i will implement the TODOS
